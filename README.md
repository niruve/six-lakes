# six-lakes

On this project we will make calculations and conclusions based on real data collected by the NOAA (The
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, an agency of the United States government) on the “Daily
Lake Average Surface Water Temperature” of six lakes (Ontario, Erie, Huron, Michigan, Superior, and St. Clair)
during the 2018 calendar year.
